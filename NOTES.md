Please check for exceeds expectations functionality.
`createEmployeeInformationContainer` could be extended to correctly validate and format data for elements.
Functions for creating elements could be contained within the scope of the module to prevent any overwriting or clashing.

Modal `close()` and `show()` funcitons should properly manage listeners for memory optimization.
Modified CSS styles can be found at the end of `styles.css`.
The `Gallery.searchProfiles()` function could be extended to search any number of data values stored in the user `profile`.
Should modify search output to display a 'No results' message.
